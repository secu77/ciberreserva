## Why

This project is about the resolution of the CTF of the Final Phase of the Bitup Alicante 2021 event.

This challenge consisted of a Boot2Root style CTF in an Active Directory. The idea was to recreate a business environment as realistic as possible (within the idea that it is a CTF) and allow 3 teams to compromise the 6 machines involved in the domain.

The fictitious company created for the setting has been named "La CiberReserva" (whose setting has been borrowed from the series La Casa de Papel).

The objective is that the participants of the challenge approach a scenario a little bit similar to what you could find in a Red Team exercise (obviously the solution will not be the one of a Red Team exercise, this writeup is far from that). The idea is to take a different approach to cybersecurity challenges and tackle complex business environments.
